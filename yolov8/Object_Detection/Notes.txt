Remember to replace the paths for these "train" and "val" with the absolute paths in wherever you |
will be cloning this repository.                                                                  |

train: /home/htootayzaaung/Desktop/Intruder_Detection_System/train/images
val: /home/htootayzaaung/Desktop/Intruder_Detection_System/val/images

1.) Training the model:

yolo task=detect mode=train epochs=50 data=data_custom.yaml model=yolov8m.pt imgsz=640 device=cpu


2.) After training the model, you might have ot test your model with the following command remember 
to replace the path of the model shown here with the acutal absolute path of the model :

yolo task=detect mode=predict model=runs/detect/train6/weights/best.pt conf=0.25 source=test/images

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
train_object_detection.py only trains the models that uses the annotations/labels that are        | 
appropriate for object detection only. The .txt files from "labels" must strictly adhere in such a| 
way that it is appropriate to train a YOLO object detection model.  				              |
